# market-brief design (v2)

Agreed design for extending market-brief with the core ideas of PASDS
(github.com/exepex/ai-stock-prediction), run entirely by Claude Code cloud routines.
Research only: no trading, no broker connections, not investment advice.

## 1. Goal
Before each market opens, publish for every watched company:
- a **predicted price range** for the next trading day (T+1) and 5 trading days ahead (T+5),
- a **direction and confidence**,
- **yesterday's range scored** as hit or miss,

plus one chart per company and one Slack message per market. The aim is a *correct range*
(right width, honestly calibrated), not an exact price.

## 2. Markets and schedule
Two routines, scheduled in the exchange's own timezone so daylight saving never shifts them.

| Routine | Cron (exchange time) | Brief ready | Benchmark / regime |
|---|---|---|---|
| India (NSE) | `CRON_TZ=Asia/Kolkata 10 8 * * 1-5` (08:10 IST) | ~08:40 IST, before the 08:45 block window and 09:00 pre-open | NIFTY 50 (`^NSEI`), India VIX (`^INDIAVIX`) |
| US (NYSE/Nasdaq) | `CRON_TZ=America/New_York 15 8 * * 1-5` (08:15 ET) | ~08:45 ET (~14:45 Amsterdam) | SPY, VIX (`^VIX`) |

- Exchange holidays: post a one-line "market closed" message and skip predictions.
- Late runs (`market_status.py` `late_run`: started after the session's close): no calls;
  `ranges.py` skips ranges whose target session has closed and ignores cues quoted after it.
- US macro data at 08:30 ET (CPI, jobs): on those days the brief states "call made before release".
- Priority: India (where capital is) first, US as a small trial. Paper only for weeks 1-6.

## 3. Inputs (all free)
**Per company:** daily OHLCV (yfinance), news (RSS), earnings and ex-dividend dates.
**US filings:** SEC EDGAR (already built). India filings: from news at first.

| Signal | US | India |
|---|---|---|
| Overnight / pre-open cue | Index futures `ES=F`, `NQ=F`; per-stock pre-market gap | Previous US close, Nikkei `^N225`, Hang Seng `^HSI`, US ADRs (`INFY`, `HDB`, `IBN`, `WIT`) |
| Implied volatility | Option chains (yfinance): ATM IV, implied earnings move | India VIX (index level only) |
| Global factors | US 10Y `^TNX`, dollar `DX-Y.NYB`, crude `CL=F`, gold `GC=F` | Same, plus USD/INR `INR=X` |
| Flows | (none) | FII/DII net flows, read from news |
| Sectors | 10 SPDR sector ETFs | Nifty sector indices |
| News sources | Google News (US), CNBC, BBC | Google News (IN), Economic Times, Moneycontrol, Livemint |

**Event calendar:** earnings, ex-dividend, F&O expiry, Fed/FOMC, RBI policy, CPI/jobs releases,
index rebalances.

**PASDS indicators (Python):** returns 1/3/5/20d, EMA(9)/EMA(21) ratio, RSI(14), ROC(10),
price vs 20-day high, ATR(14), 10-day realized vol, Bollinger width, OBV trend, volume ratio.
**Regime:** Calm / Trending / Event-heavy / Unstable from VIX, index 5-day return and volatility,
and the event calendar.

## 4. How a range is built (deterministic Python)
1. **Width:** current volatility estimate = blend of exponentially weighted realized vol and,
   where available, implied vol. Range = quantiles of recent standardized returns scaled by that
   volatility, for T+1 and T+5. Two bands: 50% and 80%.
2. **Market + stock split:** predict the index range first; stock = beta x index move + its own
   residual (beta from the last year of daily returns).
3. **Centre:** last close adjusted by the overnight cue (futures, ADRs, pre-market gap), minus any
   dividend going ex, plus a small capped drift from the signal score and the AI's direction.
4. **Events:** on earnings days use the options-implied move (US) or the stock's past earnings-day
   moves; widen on F&O expiry and central-bank days.
5. **Self-calibration:** track live coverage over the last ~60 scored ranges per market and band.
   If the 80% band hits less than 80%, widen it; if it hits clearly more, narrow it.

## 5. Role of the AI agents
- **news-analyst:** classifies news with the PASDS scheme: sentiment, relevance, novelty, event
  type (earnings, macro, product, legal, sector, analyst, M&A), urgency, geopolitical risk,
  priced-in flag.
- **bull-researcher / bear-researcher:** thesis and anti-thesis per company.
- **forecaster:** direction and confidence (0.50-0.90), or abstain. It may shift the centre
  within a capped amount and may **widen** a range for an event it read about, but may never
  **narrow** a range below the formula. All numbers come from scripts, never from memory.

## 6. Scoring (the judge)
| What | Metric | Must beat |
|---|---|---|
| Range | Coverage (hit rate vs 50%/80% target) and average width (interval score) | Naive range: last close +/- recent typical move |
| Direction | Hit rate | "No change" and "always up" |
| Confidence | Calibration by band (70% calls should hit ~70%) | Coin flip |

Reported per market, per horizon, per regime, and over rolling 30-day and since-start windows.

## 7. Testing approach
| Part | How it is tested |
|---|---|
| Range formulas (no AI) | Walk-forward backtest on the **last 1-2 years only**, recent days weighted more; each step sees only data up to that date. Sets starting parameters. An input is kept only if it improves range accuracy. |
| AI judgement | **Live forward testing only.** Never backtested, because the model may have seen past outcomes during training. |
| Verdict | Live results after 4-6 weeks (several hundred scored ranges). Weekly review adjusts parameters. |

## 8. Output
- `reports/<market>/YYYY-MM-DD.md`: yesterday (market and each stock, calls scored), today
  (table: ticker, T+1 and T+5 ranges, direction, confidence), tomorrow/week (events and risks),
  charts, data quality.
- **One chart per company** (PNG): last 60 days of price, yesterday's range vs the actual price,
  today's T+1/T+5 range as a cone with direction and confidence.
- One **overview grid** image per market.
- **Slack:** one message per market per day: headline, calls table, yesterday's hit/miss,
  link to the report. Nothing else is posted.

## 9. Repo changes needed
- `config/markets.yaml` (exchange, timezone, benchmark, regime index, holidays) and per-market
  watchlists.
- Data partitioned by market: `data/<market>/<kind>/YYYY/MM/...`.
- New scripts: indicators, regime, events calendar, ranges, calibration, charts, backtest.
- Routine prompt takes a `MARKET` parameter; two routines share the same code.
- Cloud environment: allow the extra news, Yahoo and calendar domains.

## 10. Build phases
1. Markets config, extra inputs, PASDS indicators, regime, event calendar. **(built)**
2. Range engine, self-calibration, scoring against baselines; backtest of range formulas. **(built)**
3. Charts, new report layout, Slack message, two routines. **(built; routines to be created once the
   environment's network access is set)**
4. Weekly review: what improved coverage, what to drop.
5. Relationships (knowledge graph, public data only): insider trades (US Form 4, India SEBI
   disclosures), big-investor stakes (US 13D/13G, India bulk and block deals), holdings (US
   13F, India shareholding incl. promoter pledges), and a per-company connection map (board,
   group companies, suppliers, customers, competitors) refreshed monthly. Used for
   second-order news, smart-money signals and range-widening risk flags.
   - **India (built; waiting for network access):** `collect_relations_india.py` reads NSE's
     public JSON (SEBI PIT disclosures, bulk/block deals with snapshot and archive-CSV fallbacks,
     shareholding master and pledge data) into `data/india/insiders|deals|holdings/`. Needs
     `www.nseindia.com` and `nsearchives.nseindia.com` allowed in the cloud environment.
     `relations.py` turns them into context-pack risk flags (deal >= INR 250 cr or 0.5x 20-day
     volume, promoter pledge +1 pp q/q, new or invoked pledges, insider sales >= INR 10 cr);
     the range widening from these flags is in `config/ranges.yaml` and off until the weekly
     review shows flagged tickers miss more often.
   - **Connection map, both markets (built):** edges in `data/<market>/graph/` written monthly by
     the graph-builder agent through `graph.py add` (validated, each citing a source URL;
     each monthly attempt recorded in `graph_runs/` so an empty run is not repeated daily;
     retractions are new rows). `graph.py hits` finds second-order news for the context pack
     and the news-analyst.
   **US relationships built:** Form 4 insider trades, 13D/13G stakes and 13F holdings of 23
   tracked filers (`collect_insiders|stakes|holdings.py`), smart-money views and context
   section, and a fresh-13D note on ranges (widen gated in `config/ranges.yaml`, off).

Later (parked): options for India and US, paper first, only once stock ranges are proven calibrated.

## 11. Open items
- Watchlists: decided (20 per market, 10 sectors x 2), see `config/markets/`.
- India outlet RSS checked 2026-10-05 (Moneycontrol's feeds are frozen, now read via Google News).
  2027 calendars: NSE has not published its 2027 holiday list yet (expected mid-December 2026);
  `holidays:` in `config/markets/india.yaml` holds the fixed-date ones until then. Add the BLS 2027
  CPI dates and the RBI FY2027-28 MPC dates to `config/events.yaml` when they are published,
  and confirm the provisional 2027 FOMC dates (a six-meeting schedule has been proposed).
  exchange_calendars covers XNYS only to one year after the run date (2027-10-05 when checked
  on 2026-10-05); `holidays:` in `config/markets/us.yaml` adds the two later 2027 closures.
- On the first India run with NSE allowed, check `collect_relations_india.py` field mappings
  against live responses (NSE changes field names; built from public scrapers, not yet seen live).
- Section 4 range inputs: **built** (`scripts/range_inputs.py`, switches in `config/ranges.yaml`):
  past earnings-day moves (dates and before-open/after-close timing from yfinance and, US, SEC
  8-K item 2.02; backfilled by `collect_events.py`), ex-dividend shift (dividend amounts now
  collected), index-then-stock beta split of the overnight cue (US: `ES`; India: previous `SPX`
  session with a fitted beta), and US option-implied vol (`collect_options.py`) in the width
  blend and as the implied earnings move. The range notes and the `inputs` column say which
  applied, so the weekly review can score each one live.
- Backtest of the inputs (`backtest.py`, 250 sessions to 2026-10-02/01, 80% interval score in %
  of price where the input applies, lower is better; off -> on):

  | Input | US 1d | US 5d | India 1d | India 5d | Default |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Past earnings moves (vs fixed x3) | 21.11 -> 20.72 (n 82) | 24.23 -> 24.53 (n 409) | no data | no data | US on, India off |
  | Ex-dividend shift | 7.45 -> 6.55 (n 72) | 13.60 -> 13.08 (n 359) | 4.93 -> 4.22 (n 27) | 12.79 -> 12.10 (n 138) | on |
  | Beta split (vs direct cue) | same | same | 5.50 -> 5.45 | 11.92 -> 11.92 | India on, US off |
  | All defaults (vs before) | 6.41 -> 6.41 | 15.01 -> 14.99 | 5.50 -> 5.45 | 11.92 -> 11.90 | |

  Over 440 sessions past earnings moves improve both US horizons (1d 22.77 -> 22.33, 5d
  26.53 -> 26.48): a small gain, kept for the US. India has no free earnings dates after mid-2025
  and only 2y of bars, so it stays on the fixed multiplier until stored events build up; that
  multiplier looks too wide for India (1d earnings ranges covered 97% of 38). In the US every
  stock has its own pre-market cue, so with equal weights the beta split equals the direct cue;
  US cue history is a proxy (next open gap, which flatters cues in absolute terms). Implied
  vol has no stored history: live only, judged by the weekly review.
